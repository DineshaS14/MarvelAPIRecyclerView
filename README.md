# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: Dinesha Shair

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Summary

MarvelAPIRecycleview is an android app that fetches character data from the Marvel API and displays it in a scrollable list. 
Each entry includes the character's name, description, and thumbnail image. 
Tapping on an item shows a Toast message with the character's name and position. 
The app also utilizes dividers to separate entries for better readability.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üì±üòçüï∫üèΩ**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [x] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [x] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

## Notes

The Marvel API RecyclerView app is a mobile application that utilizes the Marvel API to fetch data about Marvel characters. 
This data includes the characters' names, descriptions, and thumbnail images. 
The app then presents this information in a scrollable list using a RecyclerView, allowing users to easily browse through the characters. 
When a user taps on a character, the app displays a Toast message indicating the name and position of the clicked character. 
Moreover, to enhance visual organization, the app separates each entry in the list with dividers, providing a cleaner and more organized user interface. 
Through the process of creating this app, I learned how to integrate external APIs into Android applications, utilize RecyclerViews to display dynamic lists, 
and implement features like dividers and onClick listeners to enhance user interaction.
